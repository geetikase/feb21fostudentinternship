AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a nontechnical, popular term that refers to 
      machine learning of various types but most often to deep neural networks. 
      Cardiology is at the forefront of AI in medicine. For this review, we searched 
      PubMed and MEDLINE databases with no date restriction using search terms related 
      to AI and cardiology. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of 
      relevance. We highlight the major achievements in recent years in nearly all 
      areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will 
      take center stage in the field. Artificial intelligence requires a close 
      collaboration among computer scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and 
      other users in order to identify the most relevant problems to be solved. Best 
      practices in the generation and implementation of AI include the selection of 
      ideal data sources, taking into account common challenges during the 
      interpretation, validation, and generalizability of findings, and addressing 
      safety and ethical concerns before final implementation. The future of AI in 
      cardiology and in medicine in general is bright as the collaboration between 
      investigators and clinicians continues to excel.
